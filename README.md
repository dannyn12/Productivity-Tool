Description:
I have created a program that is a productivity tool that allows users to create a to-do list with tasks, add notes, and add events to a calendar. Users will have a chance to select to create a task or to mark a task as finished.  
The user will also be able to create notes and add important events to a calendar. The user will also have a choice to see what notes, tasks, and events they have created printed out to the terminal. The tasks, notes, and calendar 
events will be saved in Notes.txt, Tasks.txt and Calendar.txt files. The notes and tasks text files will also have the current date in the name. The calendar events will also be sorted from farthest to closest dates each time the 
user inputs an event to the calendar.

Program Documentation:
To run my program you make to first "make" the files and then run it with "./productivity-tool.exe".
